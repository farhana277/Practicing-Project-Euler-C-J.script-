# Practicing-Project-Euler--C-J.script-
Project Euler Solutions in Java Script without using any built-in methods.

This is where I share my solutions to Project Euler problems, written in the J.Script programming language. Iâ€™m working through these challenges to sharpen my problem-solving skills, improve my logical thinking, and get better at algorithms.

About This Project

Language: J.Script

Goal: Practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking

Updates: I try to add new solutions almost daily

How to Use

Each problem has its own separate file to keep things neat.
Yo can use the same logic in C and run this from your folder's cmd:

Compile the code:

gcc problemX.c -o problemX


Run the program:

./problemX

Progress

Started: August 2025

Status: Actively adding more solutions as I go
